The default render pipeline is Unity's built-in render.

To change the pipeline according to your project settings, simply access the folders:
Assets > PF desert Pack > Pipelines

Then click in the desired pipeline (".unitypackage") to re-import the assets.

WARNING: If you want to use URP or HDRP pipeline, make sure your project is configured for the correct pipeline.
